In that case we would use a simulator like Gazebo to know what would actually happen and the data from the sensors can be visualized in a visualization tool like Rviz. In case we have physical robots, then the data from the sensors can still be visualized in Rviz, but we do not need a simulator necessarily.\n\nTo get started with the installation and some beginner friendly example in Rviz, you may follow [_this link_](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FY9xGYzi_hh2C5L747Im7VsMwvI352MK#scrollTo=mKydxDSjsMCr)."},"__N_SSG":true}
